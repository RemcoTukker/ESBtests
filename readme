To use these files, do the following:

1. Setup jbossesb-server-4.11

2. Make sure to have the files and folders in a folder called testsAlmende (you'll have to do this yourself when downloading from github)

2. Drop the testsAlmende folder in the jbossesb-server-4.11 folder, then follow same procedure as with quickstart samples: run the server from JBoss' ESB bin folder with the run.sh script, move to the scenario folders and use "ant deploy" "ant runtest" and "ant undeploy".


The conf folders contains a couple of configuration files, the other folders contain the test scenarios.
