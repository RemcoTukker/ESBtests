This runtest sends a lot of very similar JMS messages to the CBR gateway, the CBR uses a very simple rule to route these messages to one of three sinks, and the sinks report (from the server terminal) when they have received a certain number of messages.

On my system, it takes about 10 sec for 3 * 2000 messages to be processed. 

******** Description of contents: **********************

src
 java source

build
 java classes

build.xml 
 ant build script that imports the base-build.xml script from the conf folder and gives the additional info that the path rules should be deployed and what the test executable is. Also requires log4j.xml

deployment.xml
 gives the info that jbrules.esb is required and queues have to be registered here

jbm-queue-service
 this seems to be the actual specification of the queues; why do we have to specify it here as well as in deployment.xml?

jboss-esb.xml
 esb config file; requires the specification of the JMS provider and again the queues... Also, how these queues are used by the services and what actions (java code) the services should perform on the messages in the queue.

jndi.properties
 provides some context to the java code

log4j.xml
 something that the ant build script requires => build.xml

SampleOrder.xml
 just some test file to be transmitted and CBR'ed

SimpleCBRRules-XPath.drl
 these contain the XPath CBR rules
